Installation
------------

The zgrepsrch.pl script relies on a Perl module called "IO::CaptureOutput".  
If you get the error message "Can't locate IO/CaptureOutput.pm in @INC", 
then install this module.  

Use cpan
--------
Issue these commands at the system prompt:

sudo cpan 
install IO::CaptureOutput

When you see "make install  -- OK", type "quit".

Use supplied IO-CaptureOutput-1.1102.tar.gz
-------------------------------------------
At the unix/linux command line issue the following commands:

tar zxf IO-CaptureOutput-1.1102.tar.gz
IO-CaptureOutput-1.1102
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
sudo make install

The installation requires "sudo" access; you must be listed in /etc/sudoers, 
and you will be required to supply your system password.  Otherwise, ask 
your systems administrator to install this module for you.  


Command invocation
------------------

Run grepsearch with the following shell script:

sh grepsearch.sh <list of files> <search string list> <output filename>
      <output dir> <script dir> <debug(1)>

If no arguments are supplied the command syntax above will be displayed.
Debug ("1") will list the command arguments.  

The grepsearch.sh script executes a perl script, zgrepsrch.pl, that searches
individual input files against the probes listed in the search string list. 

The syntax (displayed when no arguments are supplied) is:

zgrepsrch.pl -i [input list of fastq files] -p [oligo data] -o [output file]
        -n [no complement] -w [working directory]

Ordinarily, this script is executed inside of a "for" loop in the grepsearch.sh script.
